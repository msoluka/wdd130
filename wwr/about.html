            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>"Our journey began over a decade ago with a group of passionate adventurers who shared a common love for
                the untamed beauty of Congo Kinshasa's rivers. What started as a humble endeavor to explore the region's
                rapids soon evolved into a thriving rafting company, fueled by our unwavering commitment to providing
                unparalleled experiences in one of the world's most breathtaking natural settings. Over the years, we
                have navigated countless rapids, forged enduring relationships with local communities, and honed our
                expertise in delivering safe, exhilarating adventures for adventurers of all ages and skill levels.</p>
            <img src="images/trip1.jpg" alt="history image">
            <p>Our dedication to environmental conservation, sustainable tourism, and community empowerment has not only
                shaped our company ethos but also earned us the trust and admiration of our customers and partners
                alike. As we continue to chart new waters and push the boundaries of adventure, our mission remains
                unchanged: to share the thrill of whitewater rafting, celebrate the beauty of nature, and create
                memories that will last a lifetime. Join us as we embark on the next chapter of our journey, where every
                rapid promises an unforgettable adventure and every bend in the river reveals a new story waiting to be
                told."</p>
